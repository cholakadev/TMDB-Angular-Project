Park Seon-mi uses sex toys herself and writes reviews about the pros and cons, as well as points for improvement. The second girl is a hair model for \"hair-down-there\". Ah-reum sometimes provides sex to the ‘hair designer', too. The third girl's job is giving sexual services to the handicapped. Seol-yeong finds value in the work she does as a White Hand, as they call it in Japan. The fourth girl, Eun-bit, is a private tutor's assistant, where she lets the lecturer touch her body in front of the students to show how a woman's body responds to different touches. The last and fifth girl is assistant to a urologist. She helps ejaculate semen, and she's very fond of her job. The reporter anticipates future college girls' jobs.",
